Predicting preferred mode of transport for current and future employees for better HR and Admin decision making

OBJECTIVE: A human resource department handles many necessary functions of a business. Some of them are providing workforce compliance, record keeping, recruiting and training, compensation and help with handling specific performance issues. Another metric that the administration department and human resource department, may want to understand, is how to make the lives of the employees in the organization generally less complicated.  

An HR may decide to offer transport services to their employees who do not own a car and maybe estimate reimbursements of a future/current employee whose likely or is driving a car currently.  

An HR may also want to understand the broader insights of people using a car for their daily commute to work, in a relatable manner, to make future innovative decisions to bring value to the workplace. 

We have been provided with some personal and professional details of employees which has some structured pre-recorded key metrics such as age, salary, work experience etc. We have also been provided employees mode of transport i.e car, two wheeler and public transport.  
This business report shall attempt to provide you an in-depth understanding and significance of the independent variables used for our model building. We will be using predictive modelling algorithms such as logistic regression, K-nearest neighbours and Naïve Bayes. We shall evaluate model performance and compare these models to bagging and boosting models and recommend the best model based on accuracy and other measures to predict if an employee will use car as their preferred mode of transport. 

The aim of this exercise is to understand the variables that influence the use of cars (Minority Class) as a mode of transport and to explain an employee’s preference to use car as their primary mode of transport.  
The dataset of employee information provided to us current has 444 entries and 9 variables.
